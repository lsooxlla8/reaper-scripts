## Packages

### Freeze Toggle

Toggles every selected track independently:

- unfrozen track → freeze to stereo;
- frozen track → unfreeze one freeze layer.

The script preserves the original track selection and safely handles mixed selections containing both frozen and unfrozen tracks.

### Smart Freeze Toggle

Toggles every selected track independently:

- unfrozen track → measure a safe post-FX tail, then freeze to stereo;
- frozen track → unfreeze one freeze layer.

The script safely handles mixed selections and requires the
[SWS/S&M extension](https://www.sws-extension.org/).

### Smart Toggle FX Window

Toggles the FX window of the selected track:

- closed window → close all track FX windows, then open its FX chain;
- open window → close all track FX windows.

The script supports normal tracks, the master track, FX chains, floating FX,
and empty FX chains.
